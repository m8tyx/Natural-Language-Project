Me and a lot of your playerbase are based on SEA Region, most of us are third world country, when converting prices from dollar, it takes a heavy toll on our wallet. I am a willing-spent player, but even this is too much for me. I bet you if you implement it, you will get even more willing spent player.",2025-09-17 21:17:28,2

The least power creep gacha game and even so old unit still has some niche use unlike other game that old unit will be bench forever. Gameplay is very engaging and interesting.

The characters are good, the stories are interesting, not too generic, the gameplay is a bit monotone (well it is a tower defense), there are many variety of enemies but they can be simplified to just several type (Big Guy, Glass Cannon, Minions, etc.). Some of the bosses have an interesting gimmick tho. Overall its a great game if you like cute/cool character without too much fan services, and also if you don't get bored easily. For me, solid 8.85 out of 10, a better-than-decent game",2025-06-07 23:02:37,0

Although being a gacha game, Arknights allows you to complete stages even with low rarity units and each stage can be done in many different ways. Even a slight change in timing, positioning, characters, and their levels brings about different results.

fef57675-2ca2-4be3-b1e7-8e646b9f60e2,3,as far gacha games go this one is ok. the game has 2d very simple graphics. the game lacks a working auto battle for farming stages since auto does fail and often due to rng that was not recorded or timeline can be out of sync. in year 2024 this is backwards. after playing for a few months and getting some good characters leveled the game becomes too easy while at game start its very difficult if you push. gacha isnt as intrusive as in most of these games and some stages make player think.,2024-12-03 20:50:00,3

It is super F2P friendly and stages are clearable with low rarity. No need to pull for dupes to unlock a characters kit, or having to grind rng stats for equipment(HSR, Genshin). Gameplay is not repetitive and stage mechanics vary as long as you learn to read, you can clear. So if you want a gacha that finally treats you right, go play Arknights.",2024-11-18 17:28:26,1

Now if only missions had a 'claim all' button... Also relies very heavily on cheap gimmicks to force replayability ie. not letting you know enemy paths or types before 1st attempt, no restart button for flunked attempts, or spawning slugs or paratroopers right next to the blue box.

f0198ff8-ff59-4f18-a2c3-57ebd1ba037a,5,Arknights is a tower defence game that uses the gacha genre as one of its strengths. It has a wide variety of play styles because you cannot determine what characters you will get. It also has numerous exciting game mechanics and game modes; for example there is an engaging rogue like mode. It's also one of the few gachas that feels like its actively trying to get you not to spend money. It's generous in rates and in in-game currency. It also has gorgeous art and aesthetics made for all players.,2024-07-28 07:33:12,3

Years of putting up with tedious grind and instead of easy sweep-stage, HG's idea of alleviating it was to have upto 6 auto battles play out in succession, still forcing us to sit through it all. Worse still, it doesn't seem to work with older event stages. Thus, the game ends up committing what I call the cardinal sin of gacha gaming - NEEDLESSLY WASTING PLAYERS' TIME.",2024-05-25 01:08:50,35
ab23b660-b3bf-4380-bbfc-a402ba96d613,1,There are no means to getting in touch with the developers to fix bugs in the game. The original version of this game in China sends out surveys to collect feedback every once in awhile. Currently the event stages do not have the newly implemented 6x auto function (presumably because the event was originally supposed to be released before the update which implemented this feature). However this event is now released on the EN servers after the update but is relying on old code causing the bug.,2024-05-24 15:08:15,65

bb31f9d2-1f89-4d2d-9123-bbc3467b69c4,1,Bad character design (everyone loli) I think most of the developers pedo . Game is not 3D it's all 2D . Jokes aside Grinding is hard because very low fuel increasing the fuel cap will work . Gacha system is inconsistent . And story be nice but the main characters gender not revealed so it's not engaging. Dorm system is bad . Grinding is the WORST. Leveling up characters and everything is a nightmare. I don't recommend this game at all.,2024-03-20 23:18:47,3

This game is F2P friendly too, if you play this game often. You can turn on auto when you bored set up you character for battle, and let the ai take it for you, so you can lay down or doing something else while wait the stage done.

The one downside is that it can be very grindy to upgrade your stuff, but that's more of a personal gripe than anything against the game. 10/10 would recommend. And for the love of god, upgrade your Ops somewhat evenly. The amount of times you'll need to switch up your team later in the game makes it worth the extra time in advance.",2023-09-20 20:10:44,6

76dbd686-98f6-4b1e-bd97-485fda3a87b1,4,Arknights is really good but the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it consumes too much time of yours to level up the operator and is you're free to play then its really hard for you to get the limited banner operators but still you'll get one if your luck is good but you have to invest too much time on leveling those operators. Farming those resources is really hard. But overall if you're finding some thing to play that you could have fun and you don't want to invest money.,2023-06-03 01:57:02,0

The game never felt ""Pay to win"" for me because you can literally beat the game with just low rarity units. Top tier art, music and story🙌",2023-04-23 21:09:45,5

092235ec-867d-4d87-a61c-e8daf241c6d2,5,So good! One of the only gacha/tower defense game that actually depends on strategy and skill instead of just having the best characters in the game. Low rarity characters such as 3 stars can be extremely helpful and powerful too! The character art design is really good. The game has a lot of things to do without overwhelming the player.

a6fdae89-bffa-4285-92c7-9d0be66b0f52,5,The game itself is amazing. The gameplay is simple but unique. I've never been a fan of tower defence but this game is an exception. The only problem is while you are farming for certain materials there is no skip mechanism available. So it becomes really time consuming and honestly I just stop playing without even collecting enough materials. So my only suggestion would be that the developers should add a skip mechanism atleast for the levels we've 3 starred already. Amazing Game overall.,2023-01-05 22:59:03,299
c0258b1b-73cc-49d6-b5c7-549806376f01,5,It's a niche game for only those that likes strategy games or specifically tower defense. You can beat every level from just trial and error. But it's best to learn what each operator does and what the enemies do. The gacha is not bad either. You can earn the same currency you can buy with $$$. There's a lot of grinding involve but you can totally play for free. The monthly card is good value though. Just a few dollars per month. The girls aren't too bad (waifu wise). Everything is very sfw.,2023-01-05 08:18:02,5

First, the dialogue is kinda too long which is sometime wasting my time. so, i like to advise that on the upcoming event this game can reduce amount of the dialogue like the others game you guys do. Second, the auto deploy always make the error. instead of getting 3 stars, i only got 2 stars in some stage. i hope you guys can fix it. TQ",2023-01-04 23:03:21,2

However, there are a few reasons why I'm giving it a 3⭐ instead of 5⭐. 1) Further levels require you to have a high rarity or a high lvl character. Hence, you have to grind a lot (Same goes for event levels). 2) This game is not that F2P player friendly. The gacha currency is just hard to get and the character display is just short duration. So you either give up the character or use real money.",2022-11-11 23:45:15,0

If you play because the game looks good you're probably letting yourself be blinded by 2D women as to not notice the issues. The overcomplicated mechanics ironically are so bad it feels lazy in execution. Definitely predatory on the wallet pull rates are not represented accurately. I mean come on 300 pulls for one op purchase? 300*6000=1800000... That REQUIRES money.,2022-11-11 02:32:49,6

c5fbcb46-139e-4e81-8b10-b34b5aba2d2b,3,Been playing this for over a year now and I gotta say that it's one of the best tower defense games of all time. My only gripe about it is not having a skip button for stages you already completed at 3 stars. It's very battery heavy while grinding for hours on the same stage. Blue Archives features free skips and they're still doing great financially. Does having it make the game lazy? Absolutely not. It makes the game more fun and not make it a hassle when you already stressed about the gacha.,2022-10-20 15:02:37,1

It's really engaging from the get-go. If you like visual novel-esque cutscenes, then you'll love this. Love a challenge? This game provides strategic-heavy levels where every step counts.

This game is so well balanced and so accessible to free to play players. You can easily pass levels with basic units and won't need all the overpowered ones.

The stamina (sanity) prevents you from grinding yourself to death unless you buy the monthly card that gives you stamina potions. This can be good or bad depending on the person.

6a2783f7-8a34-411c-ba28-fdeef2f108b4,2,Art is good. Setting is dark and a bit depressive. Gameplay is fine it's a tower defense and luckily has fast forward. The gacha is unfair. In-game graphics are bad. Later on becomes quite grindy and unfair to lvlup high cost operators not in stats or levels but to unlock skills. It has a Autoplay function if you did the level without a helper operator. It's manageable f2p though. Also the placing controls are bad i often get asked to quit or the pulling takes couple tries or gets misplaced.,2022-08-05 11:20:16,0

While in a battle it shifts into midget cutesy mode. Where the attack animations are stale and will have you feeling bored even when you win the battle.

The gameplay is fun and challenging, the characters are beautiful with their own unique kit, the UI is also really clean.

fbfa4da9-f06a-452e-afd4-20eb62847301,5,Probably the best gacha game in existence. Gameplay is tower defence; strategy+planning allows players to find creative ways to beat a stage using low rarity/very few units. Rare units are not mandatory to clear content (but convenient to have). You can borrow a friend's support unit in battle further helping f2p/new players. Gacha system is quite generous. Has around 200 characters and they feel vibrant and alive; with a history and backstory. Events are fun and provide further lore. 10/10!,2022-06-02 10:52:51,0

This game is cute anime girls (and guys) but with some furry features (ears/tail/etc). Near-zero pedophilia or sexualization of child characters. One (freely given) skimpy bikini on a child from a summer event. That costs this game a star IMHO. Tower Defense game without P2W or PvP. Sublime music. Lovely adult women/men. Mature story.

efae982d-b67b-46fa-b4b0-893ec2949387,5,Ok so now ive been playing for 2 years and the Quality of life changes has been great but there are one thing that the community talks about and thats an auto repeat not an auto farm but an auto repeat. Its kinda hassle when im trying to work and something trying to keep in mind how long a stage will end so adding an auto repeat would be nice. Auto skip like what you did with annihilation tickets would just kill the game the auto repeat would be the best option,2022-05-25 07:53:23,1

Standard, limited, especially on Nearl Radiant banner global release, even if it got 4 6star character on the banner, I ended up getting 5 5star character on 5 ×10pulls.

I really love the dark atmosphere in general correlating with the deep lore of the world it is set in, Terra, on which is pretty much summarized to being a post-apocalyptic world, several implications and events bring up more to such, alongside with amazing soundtrack and other writing from sidestories or stories that can be treated as ""spin-offs"", which turn out to become fun events mostly, those who bring nice features of innovative gameplay or collabs with musical artists. Although I'm focusing on the lore, writing and other aspects, this is still a gacha game, so if you don't like that kind of game, really sorry for that.

I am a huge sucker for the Tower Defence genre, so this was a instant hit with me. But the TD mechanics are quite complex and levels themselve are tough as nuts, sometimes requiring a lot of hours of strategizing and practice runs, even with high rarity characters. As for the gacha, it's quite forgiving. OST is pehnomenal. And the lore is quite intense.",2022-04-06 14:23:06,1

It's quite disappointing that the others Are quite unusable for a game that is known for having a place for every operator.. I just hope that the others are not getting overshadowed by their alters Or just being left in the air which I'd like to refer to as test operators with such simple e1 talent.. Basic skill.. That even a four star can beat 🪘,2022-03-28 20:07:08,1

Recruitment is literally 100% useless (except *slowly* farming for certificates). Headhunting too expensive at 2 spins/wk. No operator drops outside of headhunting. Grinding for upgrade materials (especially E2) can take weeks to complete. Players encouraged to maintain/level up a variety of operators due to the stage variety.

It's also rather generous with currency compared to other gachas so you get decent units without spending lots of money.

The story also introduces different maps and layouts with different enemies so you have to update your team accordingly. Events are hosted regularly as well. Some are pretty hard even when you first get into them. Only downside is if you don't have many characters or they're low level you won't be able to progress very far in events.,2022-03-18 06:48:17,44

Constant rotating events with free/cheap stuff. Honestly would've rated it 5 even if it was a pc game.",2022-03-13 21:37:55,1

f63508d4-daa9-40f3-bd00-3794e2abe3c8,3,There are so many amazing and cool operators that I wish I could use but they require so much resources to level up and promote to be usable. Either increase the resources rewarded or implement an auto replay system so the grind is less painful. I also think there is an innate problem in gameplay - it requires too much precise strategy and positioning that discourages me.

Art is shifting to live 2D + Music is fantastic + Frequent events + Lots of FREE pulls and premium currency in events. There is a pity rate and a spark system. + UI is easy to use and looks good + Accomodating and responsive customer care // Recommendation: phone notifications for sanity, RIIC, announcements, etc. (Configurable by user)",2022-02-07 09:20:08,23
