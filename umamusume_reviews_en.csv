Having loveable characters, good story, and smooth game play makes for a good experience. The downside is the gameplay loop where you have to build your Umas through career mode that has the intention of messing you up with bad rng. You need to have a near perfect career without rng messing you up in order to compete for pvp and champions meetings.

Another thing is I dont understand how I can have more skills and better stats then my all my opponents and still get 8th in a race. Had to bump the game down a whole star now bc its come to my attention that the game is mostly RNG and stats are void.

The characters are great, and the fact that the devs actually reference the real horses with the girls, is something I can admire.

Playing for a few months, watched guides and got pretty deep in the horse industry. Still, i cannot FOR THE LIFE OF ME win the final of Ura Finale. My absolute favourite is when the game bends you over mid-career and forces you to use 2-3 clocks. Oh your uma won 1st place since the begining? 8TH PLACE. Retry? 14TH PLACE. Retry? Ok 1ST PLACE :)",2025-08-07 16:39:07,4

93d71249-cdfd-4323-bbbc-6f432a934eb1,5,I don't like gacha games or rogue likes. On paper I SHOULD hate this game. But I don't. The racers are endearing and it is a lot of fun to do well with a racer you have worked hard to stat properly and it is even more fun to use Bakushin and just stomp the game doing only speed training. It shouldn't be as fun as it is but it is and that is great! The only downside is I wish there was more ways to get free carats in big amounts.,2025-08-04 20:34:39,38
